    So, if I'm a 3.5 foot tall Rhinoceros from 957 Bezillion years ago, and I'm back there contemplating which piles of rocks I want to make my "grand journey to the future" in amongst, that must have happened over there by Sweden, or central Europe, or something.  ??  James Michener made the statement in his book: "Alaska", "Those rocks down there by Los Angeles take X millions of years to travel up to the area of Alaska"  (this statement is very very paraphased).  These numbers are obviously highly inaccurate, mostly because I haven't examined these sources in heavy detail.  

    <br>
    <br>

    In the Michener book, I never even made it beyond the first few chapters (if even that far), and this Rhino graphic info (on some of these rental vehicles), hasn't really been "gone over with a fine toothed comb" either.  Maybe some these statements I'm making, take on some teensy level of plausibility here.  The ancient ancient Rhinos (some of the sub-sub-species), were supposedly only 3.5 feet tall (this "animal height info" was spelled out on this Rhino graphic on this truck here -- but is highly illegible -- must not have taken a crisp photo).  The rental truck graphic spells out the fact that these fossils of these Rhinos (the 3.5 foot tall ones), were unearthed in central Nebraska somewhere.

    <br>
    <br>

    So, they became fossilized during the grand journey, but I'm curious as to where this process actually started.  I find it difficult to believe that the Rhinos roamed the plains of Nebraska all those years back, and ended up as fossils in precisely the area where they were located.  It's confusing.  It seems like those fossils gravitate along the surface of the Planet somewhere, somehow.  Surely, they didn't just start out the trip right precisely there in central Nebraska (I would think).  There's another rental truck graphic that depicts an animal called the "Haggerman Horse".  It's origin is supposedly there in Idaho where it was first unearthed.  Those rocks travel -- might only be an inch (a year).  I would wager that these animals were existing some other place globally, way way back.  It makes you curious.  ???

    The scribbling out process here got a little out of hand, the "grey out" pen got away from me
    a couple of times.  I wiped out the Corporate name, and some of the other vehicle stuff, to sort of anonymize things a bit.
